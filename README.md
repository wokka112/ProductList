# Product List

Product List (or ProductList) is an Android application designed to help retail workers track and find product prices. It is mainly useful in small shops where the
electronic point of sale system is not fully up-to-date and price tags are not on every product. In such shops it is not uncommon to have a customer wanting to
buy something the retail assistant does not know the price for. This application aims to solve that by providing a simple system where you can record product
details - name, barcode, price, category, notes - and then later search for them via barcode scanning or manually entering details into the phone. Thus, when
the customer wishes to buy a product you have no price for you can quickly find the relevant price, as long as you previously entered the product's details into
the app.
